In this section, you'll create a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) and use the Microsoft Graph API to read and render calendar items in your web app, and also create new entries in your Microsoft 365 calendar.

## Step 1: Create some calendar entries ðŸ“†
We will need some calendar entries in your calendar (in the coming few days) for this tutorial.
Sign in to your dev tenant and open your Outlook calendar and create at least 3 calendar entries within the the next week.
